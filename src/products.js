Godzilla returns as the terrifying evil monster that he was in the original film, and apart from a small appearance by a mutant sea louse, Godzilla is the only monster in the film just like he was in the original. And like the American release of the original Godzilla movie, 'Godzilla 1985' was heavily re-edited and included newly added material featuring actor Raymond Burr, who reprises the role of reporter Steve Martin.",

Yes, the basic plot is fashioned from the most generic of cinematic molds, but it somehow manages to rise above the majority of its more forgettable slasher cousins. For one thing, the kids in this film can actually act, but what truly makes Psycho Cop more than worthy of a cult following is the unadulterated fun one has watching all of the predictable action play out to the story's forgone conclusion. This film is just loads of fun to watch - and more than worthy of multiple viewings.",

        "cover": "5127ECYB5EL.jpg",
        "desc": "When it comes down to naming the best Western of all time, the list usually narrows to three completely different pictures: John Ford's The Searchers, Howard Hawks's Red River, and Hawks's Rio Bravo. About the only thing they all have in common is that they all star John Wayne. But while The Searchers is an epic quest for revenge and Red River is a sweeping cattle-drive drama ('Take 'em to Missouri! Yeeee-hah!'), Rio Bravo is on a much more modest scale. Basically, it comes down to Sheriff John T. Chance (Wayne), his sobering-up alcoholic friend Dude (Dean Martin), the hotshot new kid Colorado (Ricky Nelson), and deputy-sidekick Stumpy (Walter Brennan), sittin' around in the town jail, drinkin' black cofee, shootin' the breeze, and occasionally, singin' a song. Hawks--who, like his pal Ernest Hemingway, lived by the code of 'grace under pressure'--said he made Rio Bravo as a rebuke to High Noon, in which sheriff Gary Cooper begged for townspeople to help him. So, Hawks made Wayne's Sheriff Chance a consummate professional--he may be getting old and fat, but he knows how to do his job, and he doesn't want amateurs getting mixed up in his business; they could get hurt. This most entertaining of movies also achieved some notoriety in the '90s when Quentin Tarantino (director of Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, and Jackie Brown) revealed that he uses it as a litmus test for prospective girlfriends. Oh, and if the configuration of characters sounds familiar, it should: Hawks remade Rio Bravo two more times--as El Dorado in 1967, with Wayne, Robert Mitchum, and James Caan; and as Rio Lobo in 1970, with Wayne, Jack Elam, and Christopher Mitchum. --Jim Emerson",

        "desc": "This well-produced British documentary, one of four videos that make up The Final Solution set, begins by tracing the roots of Nazism in Germany's humiliating defeat in World War I. The ravaged society of postwar Germany, saddled with severe economic problems and vicious political infighting, was a fertile breeding ground for a small political party that few took seriously. Early Nazi publications show racist caricatures of the Jews as wily enemies of the German people. The hatred promulgated by Hitler and his followers began to be taken seriously as Germany suffered during the Great Depression, and before long Nazi racial theories were being published in schoolbooks. Well-chosen archival films document the rise of the SS, a small group of Hitler's personal bodyguards, which grew to include thousands of highly trained and fanatical racists. The SS leader, Heinrich Himmler, is seen promoting his racial theories in visits to German children and at athletic events staged by the SS, and the gradual implementation of Nazi doctrine into German law is documented. Throughout the film participants, including former SS officers, are interviewed, and a fairly comprehensive view of the earliest years of the Nazi Reich emerges. This is a solid introduction to the horrors of Nazism. --Robert J. McNamara",

        "desc": "It was perhaps inevitable that, after playing the Wolf Man, Frankenstein's monster, and the Mummy, Lon Chaney Jr. would round out his horror resum√© with a turn at the great bloodsucker himself (not, as the title would suggest, his son). Looking dapper and dignified under the cape, if not exactly threatening, Chaney plays Count Alucard (that's Dracula spelled backwards), a mysterious Carpathian summoned to America by a morbid heiress (Louise Allbritton). Eric Taylor's script is rather clunky, but the story (by horror specialist Curt The Wolfman Siodmak) is often quite clever, playing like a supernatural twist on a psycho-thriller. Allbritton's frustrated fianc√© Robert Page accidentally kills her while trying to shoot Alucard (who imperiously stands up to the hail of bullets) and then goes stark raving mad as he watches the dead rise to life and the living disappear in wisps of smoke and morph into creaky stage bats.",
